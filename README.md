BrawlCrate is a BrawlBox v0.77 fork and alternative.

BrawlBox and BrawlLib were developed initially by Kryal
(http://code.google.com/p/brawltools/source/list), then by BlackJax96
(http://code.google.com/p/brawltools2), then by libertyernie
(https://github.com/libertyernie/brawltools)

It also incorporates Sawndz by agoaj and Jaklub and a modified version of the Color Smash tool originally by Peter Hatch (https://github.com/PeterHatch/color-smash)

Current BrawlCrate contributors: soopercool101, MarioDox, Syvkal
